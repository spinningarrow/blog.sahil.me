# Colophon

I started this blog years ago when I was in class ten, writing about things
I’ve been up to and those I find interesting, with an occasional creative piece
thrown in.

If you’re amongst the negligibly few pondering over the inspiration
behind the name, I can provide two clues: computer mice, and a movie called
*Pocahontas*. The tagline is from a poem in *The Lord of the Rings*.

This blog is hosted on GitHub, with the assistance of [Jekyll][], [Vim][], and
several notebooks.
