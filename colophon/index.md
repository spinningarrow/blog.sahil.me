# Colophon

I started this blog when I was fifteen. I write about things Iâ€™ve been up to
and things I find interesting, with an occasional creative piece thrown in.

The inspiration for the name of the blog came from the movie *Pocahontas* (one
of my favourites when I was a kid), and from my love of computers.

The tagline is from a poem in *The Lord of the Rings*.
