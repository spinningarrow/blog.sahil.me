## About

Hi, I'm Sahil Bajaj. I started *The Spinning Arrow* many years ago when I was in class ten; I mostly write about what I've been up to and things I find interesting, with the occasional creative piece thrown in.

Almost no one has asked about the inspiration behind the name, so I will only say this much: a computer mouse, and a movie called *Pocahontas*.

I live in <del>sunny</del> rainy Singapore, studying Computer Science with a minor in Linguistics at [NTU][]. I recently spent half a year in Trondheim in actually-not-that-cold Norway, enjoying the pleasures of being an exchange student.

I love reading (despite the sharp decrease in time, thanks to <del>college</del> university), playing the guitar (I play half as well as I should considering the number of years I've owned one), writing (which I like to do by hand), getting to know people (and then guessing what they're thinking in the hope that [this happens][psychic]), ruminating (life, the Universe, everything!), trying my hand at new things (or leg, if the new thing is skiing), technology (which I don't own much of), and the web (which I enjoy coding for).

Some of my favourite things include [JRR Tolkien][tolkien]'s work, [The Matrix][matrix], [Iron Maiden][maiden], chocolate chip ice-cream, [Chuck][], and the serial comma.
