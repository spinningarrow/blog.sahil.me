## About

Hello! My name is Sahil Bajaj.

I can currently be found in <del>sunny</del> rainy Singapore, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics at [NTU][]. I also spent half of 2013 in Trondheim (a beautiful city in actually-not-that-cold Norway), revelling in the life of an exchange student. Besides this, I've lived in Delhi (where I grew up), Chennai, Jaipur, and Secunderabad (although I only have my parents' word to go on for this one).

I love reading books (which I’ve been neglecting, thanks to university), the guitar (which I play half as well as I should considering how many years I’ve owned one), writing (which I like to do by hand), the web (which I code for in my free time), technology (which I don’t own much of), photography (the results of which I should really get around to uploading), getting to know people (and then guessing what they’re thinking in the hope that [this][psychic] happens), ruminating (life, the universe, everything!), and trying my hand at new things (or leg, if the new thing is skiing).

A list of my favourite things would be incomplete without JRR Tolkien, *The Matrix*, Iron Maiden, *Chuck*, chocolate chip ice-cream, and the serial comma.

### The Spinning Arrow

I started this blog years ago when I was in class ten, writing about things I’ve been up to and those I find interesting, with an occasional creative piece thrown in. If you’re amongst the negligibly few pondering over the inspiration behind the name, I can provide two clues: computer mice, and a movie called *Pocahontas*. The tagline is from a poem in *The Lord of the Rings*.

This blog is published with the help of GitHub, [Jekyll][], Sublime Text, a MacBook Pro, and a Staedtler mechanical pencil.
