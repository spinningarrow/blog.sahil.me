# About

Dear reader,

Welcome to my blog, and thank you for visiting!

I started this blog when I was 15 because I wanted to write more. Blogs were at
the height of their popularity back then and self-publishing long-form writing
on the internet was a fun way to get to know other people.

This is a "life" blog in the sense that there is no specific topic for the
posts here -- they're mostly about things I've been up to and those that I find
interesting. The [categories page][] has a list of posts grouped by category.

The inspiration for the name of the blog came from the movie *Pocahontas* (one
of my favourites when I was a kid) mixed with my love of computers and
technology.

The tag line is from a poem in *The Lord of the Rings*, which is one of my
favourite books.

This blog is generated using [Jekyll][] and hosted using [GitHub Pages][]. The
source code is public and can be found here:

Best,  
Sahil
