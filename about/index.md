## About

*The Spinnging Arrow* is the personal blog of Sahil Bajaj, a name he shares with numerous possibly dissimilar individuals, thus rendering an internet search for him quite tedious. For the curious: he was born in the year 1990 and is putting it this way to obviate updates to this page every December. He also finds it peculiar to talk about himself in the third person and shall thus stop.

I'm an undergraduate at [NTU][] in <del>sunny</del> rainy Singapore, studying computer science (with a bit of linguistics thrown in), though currently I'm living in Trondheim in not-so-cold Norway, seemingly enjoying the pleasures of being an exchange student.

I love reading (despite the sharp decrease in time, thanks to <del>college</del> university), playing the guitar (I play half as well as I should considering the number of years I've owned one), writing (which I like to do by hand), getting to know people (and then guessing what they're thinking in the hope that [this happens][psychic]), ruminating (Life! The Universe! Everything!), trying my hand at new things (or leg, if the new thing is skiing), technology (which I don't own much of), and the web (which I enjoy coding for). Oh, and serial commas.

Some of my favourite things (across varied categories) include [JRR Tolkien][tolkien], *[The Matrix][matrix]*, *[Iron Maiden][maiden]*, chocolate chip, and *[Chuck][]*.
