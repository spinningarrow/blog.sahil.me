Hello and welcome my personal blog. Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Sahil Bajaj and I'm a 1990-born computer-science-with-a-bit-of-linguistics student at [NTU][] in <del>sunny</del> rainy Singapore. I recently spent half a year  in Trondheim in not-so-cold Norway, seemingly enjoying the pleasures of being an exchange student.

I love reading (despite the sharp decrease in time, thanks to <del>college</del> university), playing the guitar (I play half as well as I should considering the number of years I've owned one), writing (which I like to do by hand), getting to know people (and then guessing what they're thinking in the hope that [this happens][psychic]), ruminating (life, the Universe, everything!), trying my hand at new things (or leg, if the new thing is skiing), technology (which I don't own much of), and the web (which I enjoy coding for).

Some of my favourite things include [JRR Tolkien][tolkien], *[The Matrix][matrix]*, [Iron Maiden][maiden], chocolate chip, *[Chuck][]*, and the serial comma.
