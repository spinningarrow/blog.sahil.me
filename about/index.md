# About

Welcome to my blog! I'm Sahil -- you can find out more about me on [my home
page][].

I started this blog when I was fifteen to get myself to write more. This is not
a topical blog -- the posts are about things I've been up to and those that I
find interesting, with an occasional creative piece thrown in.

The inspiration for the name of the blog came from the movie *Pocahontas* (one
of my favourites when I was a kid), and from my love of computers.

The tagline is from a poem in *The Lord of the Rings*, which is one of my
favourite books.

This blog is generated using [Jekyll][]. The source code can be found on
