title: "The Summer 2010 Movie List"
---

I have a strong strange feeling that this list should be somewhat longer, but oh well, this will have to do.

I dislike writing reviews on account of redundancy so ...

1. *Dead Poets Society*: No.
1. *Seven Pounds*: Not really. Well, maybe.
1. *Slumdog Millionaire*: Probably.
1. *(500) days of Summer*: Yeah, kinda.
1. *Across the Universe*: Perhaps until I know the Beatles better.
1. *The Fast and the Furious*: No!
1. *Fast & Furious*: No!
1. *Pan's Labyrinth*: No. Yes. (Maybe not sometime soon?)
1. *Six Degrees of Separation*: Probably.
1. *The Dark Knight*: A little.
1. *The Matrix Reloaded*: No!
1. *The Matrix Revolutions*: No!
1. *How to Train a Dragon*: A little?
1. *Iron Man 2*: Nah.
1. *Prince of Persia*: Yeah.
1. *Shutter Island*: I think so.
1. *Knight and Day*: No. (Well, not really)
1. *Inception*: No! (Not. At. All!)

... this answers whether or not I'd be reluctant to watch these again. (A better expression of a movie's worth, if you ask me. *I wonder why no one does ask me...*)

PS. My [cellphone woes][1] are *still* not over, can you believe that?
