title: A year of movies
---

Thanks to the infectious film-buffiness of G, I have probably watched more
movies in the cinema in the last year (including an unplanned viewing of
_Fantastic Four_ in Taipei thanks to a raging typhoon outside) than in the last
decade. I now know which cinema chain in Singapore has the best hotdogs
(Cathay), the longest advertisements (Golden Village at _twenty five minutes of
pre-movie ads_), and the easiest online booking experience.

I even [attempted to keep a film diary][letterboxd] – it's mostly accurate but
there really should be a way to completely automate these things. Here are some
of the more notable movies:

1. **Black Mass**

	With a grim but intense story, this film had some great performances
(finally featuring Johnny Depp as a character who actually looks like a regular
human). Also, I was amazed to find out yesterday that the female lead is the
same person as in _50 Shades of Gray_ – talk about versatility!).

3. **Big Hero 6**

	I was expecting this to be so-so (I’d never heard of the comic, and the
name sounded a little silly) but it turned out to be one of the most
entertaining animated movies I’ve seen in a very long time.

7. **The Hundred Foot Journey**

	It turns out that I quite enjoy movies centred around food. This one had an
interesting mix of characters (though I think I have a tendency to always be a
little surprised when I see Indian actors in an English movie), some pleasant
locations and a nice storyline.

2. **Kingsman**

	A self-aware take on typical spy movies, made quite enjoyable thanks to
[certain action sequences][kingsman-fight] and [visual
effects][kingsman-exploding-heads].

4. **Interstellar**

	I find it pretty cool that the visual designers had to write new software
based on the consultant physicist’s equations, and also that this resulted in
the publication of two scientific papers.

5. **Bridge of Spies**

	_Spoiler alert!_ I kept expecting the main character to die, and even
though he didn’t I found that I ended up liking Tom Hanks’ role and the story.

6. **Focus**

	Will Smith! I hadn’t seen him in a movie in aeons and this one was
continuously entertaining with some unexpected twists.

**PS**: I rarely do these end-of-the-year posts but thanks to almost no
blogging this year, I thought I'd give it a try. What say?
