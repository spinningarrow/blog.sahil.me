title: Why, hello!
---

Okay, nearly four-and-a-half-months later, I'm back! :D And you shake your collective heads and think, "Ha, this guy isn't going to last a *week*." Honestly, I don't think I've *ever* gone so long without posting on my blog (a month seems to be the previous record - now broken by a hopefully insurmountably wide margin). I was still in class 11 when I last posted ... then so many things happened, almost at the same time and I got so busy that I thought I'd post everything together ... later. And yes, that's an excuse :). But seriously, it's a vicious cycle - a whole lot of stuff happens because of which I think I'll post all about everything later, but later more things happen, so later gets even later and later (or umm ... *even later*?) I realize that there are so many things to post that I kind of white-out and don't feel like posting anything and then later after that I decide I should but then I don't, and then - and then ... well, you get the picture.

So. I have holidays! Not to mention that this is the first set of holidays we're getting after the winter break, which, incidentally happened to be a loooong time ago. I mean, it's not fair - when [sister dear][] finishes her year of college, she gets a whole *[two-and-a-half months][1]* while us poor eleventhies get a whopping grand total of two *days*! Sheesh.

Well, anyway, I plan to make the most of the holidays ('plan to' being the operative clause). I have, by the way, been learning to play <del>with</del> the guitar, although since I've broken the same string twice already, I'm not sure how much I'm progressing.

Oh we also had our Investiture Ceremony recently. I had to give a speech in *Hindi* which isn't something I've ever done before. Marching practice was fun though, largely because of the instructor. At least in the beginning. Later, almost everyone began to figure out how it's really done and it got positively boring in the end.

Well, that's it for now. (Mustn't bore you all with an information overload).
