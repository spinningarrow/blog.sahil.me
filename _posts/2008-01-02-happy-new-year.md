title: Happy New Year!
---

First of all, here's wishing all of you a *very* happy New Year! May this year bring you joy, success, health, happiness and basically everything you want it to :).

***

Sometimes I think that the "New Year" is just a little bit too hyped. After all, it didn't "feel" any different (except perhaps that it was colder). Sometimes, I think that the hype is actually a good thing. It gets you to think about all you've been up to the previous year (or, in many cases, all you've *not* been up to) and <del>make resolutions</del> think about the future. (Of course, it also gives you a reason to celebrate).

By the way, I don't think I'm going to make any resolutions this year. I don't see any point in making resolutions that I can't keep, and consequently, in making resolutions at all. The only thing I will *try* to do is to post more frequently (though that's something I've been saying for a long time now).

I also celebrated my birthday a few days back. I didn't exactly mean to mention it, but I am now because: (a) I celebrated it after two years, and consequently enjoyed it a lot; and (b) I just can't *not* tell you that if (by any chance) you decide to celebrate your birthday in Pizza Hut, unless you're some big attention-seeking person, *do not* let them know it's your birthday! Trust me, it *isn't* worth the one spoon of ice-cream they give you in return.

Oh, and some time or the other, I also redesigned [my sister's blog][1] (after endless pestering, of course).
