title: Writing about myself is hard (so here's a tag!)
category: journal
---

Updating [my homepage][sahil.me] the other day made me realise once again how
terrible I really am at writing about myself, at least in the direct manner
that an 'about me' feature generally demands. I eventually managed to put some
words together but that got me thinking -- I've never done a tag on this blog
before. Yes, *never*. I avoided that boat entirely in blogging's heyday, and of
course things are lot different now. After a lot of googling (sadly, the word
"tag" is kinda overloaded), I found one that seemed like a good one to begin
with. Here goes:

1. Are you named after anyone?

	No, I don't think so. But I *was* slightly excited when a friend from
	Azerbaijan told me that [they have a place with the same name][sahil] there!

2. When was the last time you cried?

	Hmm, I can't really remember so it's been a while! Sometimes I feel really
	moved by music, but rarely to the point of tearing up.

3. Do you use sarcasm a lot?

	I try to be sarcastic as often as possible, but usually only
	after I've gotten comfortable with the receiver.

4. What’s the first thing you notice about people?

    Their eyes.

5. Scary movie or happy endings?

    Scary movie with a happy ending? I'm actually not a huge fan of either -- I
	prefer interesting movies that end on a goodish note but leave one thinking
	about what exactly transpired after the movie.

6. Favourite smells?

	Trees! And wet grass. Oh and onions as they fry!

7. Where were you born?

	I was born in a city called Secunderabad. Thanks to India's obsession with
	renaming and redividing places, the state Secunderabad belongs to has
	changed since my birth. Confusion ensues when it's time to produce my birth
	certificate for verification.

8. Do you have any pets?

	No. I like animals but I'm not big on pets. Semi-relatedly, I really do not
	like zoos.

9. Do you have any siblings?

	Yes! I have an elder sister (I say "elder", but really the difference is
	only 1.5 years -- does that count?)

10. Who was your first best friend?

	The first person I designated as my "best friend" was probably this guy who
	joined nursery school on the same day as I did. We've since fallen out of
	touch, though we're still friends on social media!

11. How many countries have you visited?

	I should know this, having had to fill this on numerous occasions for all
	the pesky visa forms. Let's see -- Nepal, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia,
	Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, and China. And Norway, Lithuania, Latvia, Sweden,
	Belgium, France, Austria, Czech Republic, Netherlands, and maybe a few
	more? And India of course.

	I hope to visit more places, though I daresay the exact number of countries
	really doesn't matter.

12. What was your favorite/worst subject in high school?

	I had two favourites: English and Computers (I can't recall if the subject
	was literally called "computers" or not -- it's a bit of a strange name if it
	was!).

	My least favourite was… probably something that involved a bunch of rote
	learning. I vaguely remember having to learn the exact temperature and amount
	of water that was suitable for growing fields of rice -- for Geography
	class I think.

13. Favorite memory from childhood?

	This one's difficult; I don't really keep track of something like this! Off
	the top of my head, I've always enjoyed all the times I've visited my
	grandparents and relatives who stay in a little village high up in the lower
	Himalayas.

14. What phone do you have? (iOS or Android?)

	I have an iPhone 6S. I switched to an iPhone a couple of years after using
	a Xiaomi Redmi for a bit (which was my first foray into smartphones) and
	literally could not be happier with that choice.

15. What sports do you play?

	Nowadays, I mostly play table tennis with some occasional cycling and
	indoor climbing thrown in.

And that's a wrap. This would be the moment where I'd pick other people to do
this tag, but there are so few active non-topical bloggers in my list now that
I don't know if that would go anywhere. How about this -- if you're reading
this and still blog, do this tag! And then tell me about it and we can talk
about how blogging is still alive!
