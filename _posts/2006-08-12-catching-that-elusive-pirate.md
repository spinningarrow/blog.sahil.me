No, it's just too bad. You know, just a few days after I first saw Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, I got to know that a sequel was being made. And of course, I decided that time only that I <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span> see it.<br /><br />Then later I came to know that it was being released on July 5, except it came here only 2 weeks late. Well, anyway, ever since then I've been wanting to see it, and somehow or the other, I don't seem to get the chance. Either dad's to busy, or I have to go for a competition, or my sister's got some work, or there's no time...well, you get the gist.

Now, today I'm supposed to be going for it (in precisely half an hour), though with all the bad luck with me and this movie, I won't be surprised if I get blown up half-way through.

The first movie, by the way, was superb. Johnny Depp's acting, the wisecracks, the story and Johnny Depp's acting really made it fun. I liked the wisecracks especially, coz they kept me grinning most of the time.<br /><br />[<span style="font-style: italic;">Will is caught and Jack soon follows suit</span>]<br />Will: Jack! Where's Elizabeth?<br />Jack: Elizabeth's safe and sound, just as I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised; and you're going to have to die for her, just like <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> promised, so we're all men of our words really...except Elizabeth who is, in fact, a woman.<br /><br />[<span style="font-style: italic;">Then, Jack and Barbossa are talking</span>]<br />B: Jack, I never thought you had it in you to do this.<br />J: You know me, I'm completely dishonest. You can always trust the dishonest people to be dishonest - honestly - it's the honest ones you have to be careful of. You never know when they might do something incredibly <span style="font-style: italic;">stupid</span>.<br />[Following, which, Jack and Will start fighting B]

Oh well, I guess it doesn't even sound half as funny as it did then.

This, by the way, is just a temporary sort of desk, till I make a better one.
