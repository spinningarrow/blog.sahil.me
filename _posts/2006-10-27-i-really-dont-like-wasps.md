Oh, wait! Most of you guys don't know where I was when I wrote this. See, we
had holidays (or what I call a well-deserved break) after the exams, so I'd
gone to spend a few days in a place called the <span style="font-style:
italic;">Country Club</span>.

Anyway, needless to say, I didn't actually make any real errors as such. And I
did have quite an enjoyable time, marred by the only fact that we didn't spend
enough time there.

Well, actually, when I went there, there were only tripods for the telescopes.
The telescopes were fixed only at night, something which I didn't come to know
of until it was day again and they were removed.

Oh, and I (finally) read and bought (in reverse order) <acronym title="Artemis
Fowl 5">AF5</acronym>. But more about that later.
