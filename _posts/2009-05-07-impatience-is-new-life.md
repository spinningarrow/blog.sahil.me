title: “Impatience is the new life”

Blogger has been *very* annoying lately. It dislikes my commenting on other people's blogs, it dislikes my trying to complete my template - it even tries to stop me from posting! First I thought it was because of the internet - which had been acting up (surprise!) - but that got okay. It's still astonishingly slow though. *Why* can't there be broadband which is fast, reliable and inexpensive (simultaneously)?

`<geek>`My computer refuses to recognise my external hard drive when I connect it to the front USB ports. My (Intel) mobo manual says the front ones are also USB 2.0. Wth?`</geek>`

I went to school yesterday! It was fun, meeting all my teachers and friends - though it felt a *little* odd too, if you know what I mean :D.
