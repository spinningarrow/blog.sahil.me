It was with great purpose that I packed my suitcases when I left Delhi last
summer. They were heavy not with food as is customary, but with a collection of
books that would have long been gathering dust (had they not been kept inside a
closed bookshelf). University life, you see, had not been at all kind to the
first "official" pastime I ever had.

Soon after I procured a room in Singapore, I found myself also procuring a
membership from the National Library. And if that weren't enough proclamation
of my campaign for renewed prosaic consumption, I also ended up being gifted a
lovely Kindle for my birthday (from the even lovelier G).

Thus armed, I embarked on a journey of recovering my voracious appetite for the
chapter-chopped chronicle. Here’s how I’ve fared so far:

1. _Crime and Punishment_, Fyodor Dostoevsky
2. _The Tell-Tale Heart_, Edgar Allan Poe
3. _The Catcher in the Rye_, J D Salinger
4. _To Kill a Mockingbird_, Harper Lee
5. _Slaughterhouse Five_, Kurt Vonnegut
6. _Kane and Abel_, Jeffrey Archer
7. _The Secret Crown_, Chris Kuzneski
8. _The Girl Who Played With Fire_, Stieg Larsson
9. _The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest_, Stieg Larsson
10. _Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit_, P G Wodehouse
11. _Chronicle of a Death Foretold_, Gabriel Garcia Marquez
12. _Kafka on the Shore_, Haruki Murakami
13. _And Then There Were None_, Agatha Christie
14. _Crooked House_, Agatha Christie
15. _Dune_, Frank Herbert
16. _Ender’s Game_, Orson Scott Card
17. _Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop
    Culture_, David Kushner
18. _The Last Lecture_, Rany Pauch

It's not terrible, but still a distant cry from the yours truly of yore who
used to finish several books a week (a particularly memorable one-day reading
of _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_ comes to mind).

What's interesting is that the list of books that I began reading but couldn't
keep up with is also nearly as long, which is a telling sign of the changing
times (I've almost never _not_ finished a book in the past). Some of them are
non-fiction ones though – can I pretend that they don't count?

Oh well. Time for Susan Sontag’s _On Photography_!
