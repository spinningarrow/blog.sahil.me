I really really really *really* don't like being sick.

*Especially* colds. They're so ... annoying. Because you feel way worse than you really are (I mean, no fever, for heaven's sake!)

Pshht.

Stuff has been happening. Or rather, not happening even though it needs too. Now if only it could happen on its own ...

[No, there's no need to scratch your heads, even I know I'm not making sense].

Don't you find [text-killers][tk] so *annoying*?

Later!
