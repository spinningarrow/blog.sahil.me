I like this! See for the site statistics for this blog, I'm using <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> because I got an invitation from them (I applied for it). Anyway, so here's what I see in the browsers being used by visitors to this site:

Yay! All hail the Firefox users!

Soon, I'd like to see IE as instead of the second largest segment, at 0%.

<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/" title="Firefox">Download Firefox here (those who're using Internet Explorer)</a>.
