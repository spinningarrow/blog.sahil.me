Wheeew!<br /><br />It's already the middle of March and the boards are (finally) more than half-finished ... only <span style="font-weight: bold;">three</span> more exams left (yay!)<br /><br />They've been okay so far ... but mostly not <span style="font-style: italic;">quite </span>as good as I'd have wanted them to be ... anyway ... whatever ...<br /><br />Signing off,<br />Sahil
