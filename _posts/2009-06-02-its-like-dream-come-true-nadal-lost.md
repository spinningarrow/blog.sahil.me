title: Will he? Or won't he?
---

It's like a dream come true - NADAL *lost*. On *clay*. In the *French Open*. In the *fourth round*. *Nadal* lost, did I mention? Yes, *Nadal*. It's like so ZOMGWOW! =D If Federer *still* somehow manages to make a hames of it when Nadal has been ever so nice to have handed him the keys, then as one of my friends said, he probably doesn't deserve it anyway :P. He hasn't been playing all that well and nearly gave us a scare in his five-setter today. Oh! that reminds me, check out this *awesome* video of Federer playing air guitar (well, kind of).

Which reminds me of this (largely) unrelated advertisement of [Intel's Rockstars][].

I can't see tennis on my TV though! It is *so* annoying. I have this Tata Sky and most of the channels can't be seen on it due to some crappy reception problem ... all I get is noise and fuzz. I watched the match (or part thereof) today on the [official Roland Garros website][rg], with the Live Radio thing turned on. It was quite fun actually, except the radio and scoreboard were out of sync *eyeroll*.
