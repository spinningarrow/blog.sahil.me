title: Acronym day
---

The other day, I woke up in my <abbr class="acronym" title="Nanyang Tehcnological University">NTU</abbr> room in sunny <abbr class="acronym" title="Singapore">SG</abbr>, all ready for an interview later that afternoon. Taking the <abbr class="acronym" title="Campus Rider - Red line">CR-R</abbr> bus past <abbr class="acronym" title="National Institute of Education">NIE</abbr> to the <abbr class="acronym" title="Lee Wee Nam">LWN</abbr> bus stop made me realise it was a little _too_ sunny though, a fact underscored by my progressively soaking shirt. I had originally planned to travel by the <abbr class="acronym" title="Mass Rapid Transit">MRT</abbr>, but while sitting in <abbr class="acronym" title="Singapore Bus Service">SBS</abbr> Transit's bus 179 and passing by the <abbr class="acronym" title="School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering">SCBE</abbr>, <abbr class="acronym" title="Research Techno Plaza">RTP</abbr>, <abbr class="acronym" title="Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information">WKWSCI</abbr>, <abbr class="acronym" title="Humanities and Social Sciences">HSS</abbr> and other buildings, I decided instead to head to <abbr class="acronym" title="Jurong Point">JP</abbr>. Reaching there, I made a beeline for <abbr class="acronym" title="G2000">G2K</abbr> and bought another shirt (or two, actually, thanks to a sale and my dearth of fitted shirts).

I quickly hailed a cab. I can't remember if we took the <abbr class="acronym" title="Pan-Island Expressway">PIE</abbr> or <abbr class="acronym" title="Ayer Rajah Expressway">AYE</abbr>, but unlike most cab drivers, at least this one didn't ask me which route to take. Driving past a lot of <abbr class="acronym" title="Housing and Development Board">HDB</abbr> neighbourhoods, we soon reached the location. It was quite close to <abbr class="acronym" title="Institute for Infocomm Research">I2R</abbr> – the place I'd been working with for my <abbr class="acronym" title="Final Year Project">FYP</abbr> (which thanks to <abbr class="acronym" title="School of Computer Engineering">SCE</abbr>'s mismanagement, turned out to be wildly different from the original one I'd applied for).

After the interview, I had some coffee and cake at Starbucks (so <abbr title="expensive">ex</abbr>!). I joined some friends and we all went for S's birthday to Boat Quay (which houses a lot of nice restaurants, bars, and cafés in the <abbr class="acronym" title="Central Business District">CBD</abbr>). A bit of unwinding at <abbr class="acronym" title="Clarke Quay">CQ</abbr> followed, and soon it was time to sleep.

P.S. This is just the tip of Singapore's acronym iceberg.
