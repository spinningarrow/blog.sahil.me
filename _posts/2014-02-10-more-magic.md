Strange, [more beautiful][magic] music. Headphones are nice, but speakers are just something else.

When I went on exchange last year, I knew getting a place on campus once I return would be difficult (thanks to NTU's awfully  convoluted and prejudicial hall points system). Little did I know that I would have to wait more than a semester – I was expecting a few weeks at most.

The conventionally wise would say that since I have only a couple of months left to graduate, I shouldn't <del>waste</del> spend much time setting up my new room, but I just couldn't resist. I blame the dopamine and my newfound realisation of personal space.

Also, I can't believe Baze and Adi put up with me for nearly _six_ months – kudos to them!
