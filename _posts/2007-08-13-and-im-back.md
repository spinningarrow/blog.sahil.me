Well, it's been another terribly loong time, something I seem to be getting quite good at. Sometimes I think I should announce a hiatus, but I end up thinking that I might as well write an all-out post - but I somehow never quite end up getting there.<br /><br />The problem with writing a post after such a long time is that I have absolutely NO idea where to start. I'll simply compromise by posting parts of what I intended to earlier, and then some more.<br /><br />So anyway, I've made some small changes around here, such as, bringing the links back. They're now updated and contain most of the blogs that I read. If, by any chance, I've forgotten to add yours truly, do tell me. And I've also added the links of photoblogs and comic blogs.<br /><br />Chalo then, more later (Now that I come to think of it, I had to say something about Harry Potter).<br /><br />By the way, here is an interestingly weird something I found:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_eJimuJOoqL4/RsA-gUo7zsI/AAAAAAAAABI/rUJvRRVy5yY/s1600-h/Piracy+Global+Warming.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_eJimuJOoqL4/RsA-gUo7zsI/AAAAAAAAABI/rUJvRRVy5yY/s400/Piracy+Global+Warming.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5098143503200538306" border="0" /></a>
