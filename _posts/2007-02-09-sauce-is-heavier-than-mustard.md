So, we (finally) had our Exun Farewell today in Nirulas (Chanakya). It was rather good - there were more people than last year (although that's probably because we have more members now). Here's a (random) list of much of what happened:<br /><br />1) Kartikeya and I were the only two (of around ten, officially) tenthies present<br />2) When we arrived (Karky and I) we found loads of people standing outside under the (wrong) impression that sir hadn't arrived<br />3) Aditya Jain's driver had him and many of the juniors gallavanting to god-knows-where till they finally succeeded in reaching [the correct branch of] Nirulas<br />4) Mohit sported a really cool haircut<br />5) Sid (one of the twelfthies, ie, one of the people for whom the farewell was being held) completely forgot about the farewell<br />6) We had pizza. Lots of it. Around 20 I think.<br />7) Karky got terrrorized by Gudi and Mohit<br />8) Sauce, mustard and chilli flakes got put into a total of <i>three</i> coke glasses (as opposed to one, last year)<br />9) The juniors actually said that it tasted <i>nice</i><br />10) We took photos (obviously!)<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">______________</span><br /><br />* Well, it might just be that sauce is miscible in Coke, whereas mustard isn't, but who cares?
