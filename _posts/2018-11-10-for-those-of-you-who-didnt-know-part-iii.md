_You have arrived at Helsinki airport_.

I feel a familiar sense of excitement. There is something about this place.
The characteristic smell of coffee that permeates everything. The crisp autumn
air outside. Clear blue skies. Slanting rays of light climbing over the
horizon. The quiet energy of people walking by.

Things have a way of snowballing before a big event. I used to put this down to
my chronic procrastination -- always scrambling to get everything done at the
last minute. Didn't I start early this time though? Moving day arrived with
only two weeks notice, but other preparations had begun months before.

At least the era came to an enjoyable end. Or did it?

Suddenly Singapore is far away, and I'm looking at autumn leaves in
Hamburg. When I stop and think about it, it still feels a little unreal. But
who has the time to stop and think?

_Round every corner there may wait<br>
A new road or a secret gate<br>
I must explore them all today<br>
Or will I pass again this way?<br>
Time for the eager paths that run<br>
Towards the Moon or to the Sun.<br>_

I am back in my favourite corner of the world.
