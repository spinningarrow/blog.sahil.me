title: The coldest place on Earth
category: journal
---

I shiver, instinctively wrapping my arms around around myself. _Whereâ€™s the
tissue?_

I look around. Everyone else is covered in thick jackets. The couple sitting
behind me is buried in a blanket with only their eyes peeking out.  They seem
all right.

I fish some tissues out of my pocket and wipe my nose. Pulling my jacket
tighter, I try to not let myself be distracted by the cold. 

It doesn't work. Tendrils of cold have somehow found their way through my shoes
and socks into my toes. Despite many layers of clothing, my face is still
exposed. I'm convinced that the tips of my ears are beginning to freeze.

I rub my hands to keep them warm. I can see the others shivering, but they look
ahead. They've given in to the cold years ago; it no longer surprises them. 

Another blast of cold air assails me from behind. I have nothing more to cover
myself with! I ball myself up in a futile attempt to limit how much of my body
is exposed. 

Two hours later, I step out of the movie theatre into another humid Singapore
evening.
