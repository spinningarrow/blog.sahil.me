title: "Omelettes and Trees"

As it turns out, a whole year *is* a tad too long to be away from home [for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercorrection). I landed in Delhi last night (*“Twenty two degrees on a winter night?!”* and *“Immigration officials in India are <em>mean</em> to foreigners”*), made my way out of the airport without any incident (quite unlike last year, when I was asked for a bribe by the customs official at the [Green Channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs#Red_and_Green_channels) while he dipped his moustache in tea), found my sister and dad at the gate and talked non-stop to them on the way home (between mouthfulls of [Dairy Milk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_Dairy_Milk), that is), hugged my mom at the door (who thankfully forgot to ask who brought the luggage up the four flights of stairs), and proceeded to peer around the [drawing room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_room) to see if anything had changed (“Where's the TV gone?!”).

I then spent a good bit of time pottering around the house examining everything from coffee tables to Christmas cards, opening all the cupboards in my room (“Where did *those* books come from?”), lamenting the lack of speakers (I've grown quite used to [listening to loud music every day](http://blog.sahil.me/posts/magic/), which is a marked difference from my first year in college when I listened to practically no music for a whole semester), hunting for a Singapore-to-India plug adapter, weighing arbitrary household items with my sister's travel luggage weighing scale (if only I had that before leaving I wouldn't have had to hand my things over to a certain someone at the airport) till I could bear it no longer and picked up both my guitars making a prolonged arrival announcement to my neighbours by ‘testing’ my guitar amp (there's nothing quite like the sound of a real amp), never mind the late hour. My overexcitedness refused to let me spend enough time [tuning my guitar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uPvABrN7sA) though, instead peppering me with dilemmas of the “What should I do now?” sort: Unpack? Read a book? Call someone? Watch television? Plan what to do over the next two weeks? Eat? Sing at the top of my voice?

I ended up compensating for my indecision by reading the preface of [*Summer Lightning*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46761.Summer_Lightning) (yes, I literally read books from cover to cover — no, that's *not* the [reason](http://readers-block.urbanup.com/3955587) it took me a year to finish [*The Book Thief*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief)) and turning in for the night, to be awoken to [Flipkart](http://www.flipkart.com/)'s delivering [*Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9307674-the-last-guardian) at noon.

It's *great* to be back home.
