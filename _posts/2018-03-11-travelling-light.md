I just got back from a two week vacation, and this is the luggage I took:

(Not pictured is [my packable day bag][matador-bag]. I usually take it empty and then put
things in it like my camera, extra jacket, snacks, and water when I go out
exploring for the day.)

I clearly remember the day I arrived in Norway with two large suitcases, a
duffel bag, and an extra jacket that didn't fit anywhere. It was minus 10
degrees, there was snow and ice everywhere, and I had to climb up a hill to get
the keys to my apartment. Trying to lug everything behind me, I watched in
horror as one of my suitcases slipped out of my freezing grasp, snagged my
jacket and then proceeded to roll over it on its way down the slope.

I swore to myself that I would never _ever_ carry that much luggage with me
again.

Inspired by [some posts][zenhabits-bag-1] [on zenhabits][zenhabits-bag-2] and
[Ankur's blog][ankur-backpack], I decided to try it out on my next trip (it
helped that the airline charged even for carry on suitcases, and I was a poor
student back then) and was immensely pleased by the results. I've been
travelling like that nearly everywhere since 2013 and I can’t tell you how
freeing and amazing it has been!

It means not having to worry about checked-in bags being lost, being able to
get out from the airport quickly, not being forced to take the elevator every
time you’re at a train station because there are too many bags to lug up the
stairs, and being able to check out in the morning but still spend the day
walking around because your luggage is so easy to manage. Carrying less also
makes for easier repacking without accidentally leaving things behind.

There are three keys to packing light — pack things that are versatile, do some
laundry while travelling, and a principle borrowed from the programming world
called You Ain't Gonna Need it (or YAGNI for short). Do you really need to
carry 20 pairs of socks for a five day trip? Or your laptop, iPad, Kindle,
phone, _and_ paperback? Just because an airline allows checking in two 23-kg
suitcases doesn't mean that you must.

I try to be practical about the things I carry — if it’s unlikely that I’ll
need a particular item, I don’t take it. If I find I completely misjudged it
and the thing I forgot to take isn't too expensive, I might buy it at my
destination. But I've rarely needed to do that.

For my recent trips I've been lucky enough to stay with people that had washing
machines and driers. On other trips, I take some laundry detergent and wash my
t-shirts and other things while showering or in the basin.

To sum up: try travelling light the next time you go somewhere, and it may just
completely change how you travel!
