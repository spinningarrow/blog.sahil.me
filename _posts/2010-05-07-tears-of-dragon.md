> For too long now,<br>
> There were secrets in my mind<br>
> For too long now,<br>
> There were things I should have said;<br>
> In the darkness,<br>
> I was stumbling for the door<br>
> To find a reason,<br>
> To find the time, the place, the hour
>
> Waiting for the winter sun<br>
> And the cold light of day<br>
> The misty ghosts of childhood fears,<br>
> The pressure is building<br>
> And I can't stay away;
>
> <em>I throw myself into the sea<br>
> Release the wave,<br>
> Let it wash over me<br>
> To face the fear<br>
> I once believed<br>
> The tears of the dragon<br>
> For you and for me
>
> Where I was,<br>
> I had wings that couldn't fly<br>
> Where I was,<br>
> I had tears I couldn't cry<br>
> My emotions<br>
> Frozen in an icy lake<br>
> I couldn't feel them,<br>
> Until the ice began to break
>
> I have no power over this<br>
> You know I'm afraid;<br>
> The walls I built are crumbling<br>
> The water is moving<br>
> I'm slipping away</em>
>
> <em>I throw myself into the sea<br>

> For you and for me

> Slowly I awake,<br>
> Slowly I rise,<br>
> The walls I built are crumbling<br>
> The water is moving<br>
> I'm slipping away</em>
