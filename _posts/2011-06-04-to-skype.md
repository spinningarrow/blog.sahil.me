I spent most of yesterday (and some of today) Skyping. It's funny how I actually Skype a lot more at home (almost everyday!) than at college. It's the hectic schedule, I tell you! This also explains why I've done next to nothing in the last two days.

I still remember the first Skype conversation I ever had - it was some two years ago; I was using Skype from my PSP (my PC didn't have a mic) and I spoke to one of my friends in the US in what was probably a very unnecessarily excited voice.
