Another 'inhuman' post, I guess.<br />Anyway, I subscribe to the Artemis Fowl newsletter, you know (or is that the Eoin Colfer newsletter?). So, it was said that the fifth Artemis Fowl is being released in September. Well, it seems that they've preponed it, so now it's releasing on <span style="font-weight: bold;">August 3</span>. Which, by the way, is really very good.<br /><br />Check out the newsletter <a href="http://newsletters.penguin.co.uk/go.asp?/bPEN001/mUUKDK2/q3LBMK2/uCAQFF/x4PM432" title="Artemis Fowl: The Lost Colony">here</a>.
