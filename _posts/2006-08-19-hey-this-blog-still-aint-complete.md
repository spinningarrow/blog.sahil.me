Well, this is just to say that I'm working on it (again) after a <span
style="font-style: italic;">long</span> break. So you might see some odd stuff
going on - try to ignore it for a while, okay?

And can anyone tell me about this - Abhishek pointed out that both the links to
the feed in the sidebar (Atom and RSS) take you to the same place, ie, the Atom
feed. If you hover over the link, you'll see atom.xml as the destination in the
link to the RSS feed. But if you view the source, the same link says 'rss.xml'.
What's on?
