Well, this is just to say that I'm working on it (again) after a <span style="font-style: italic;">long</span> break. So you might see some odd stuff going on - try to ignore it ( <img src="http://members.lycos.co.uk/sahil/smile.gif" class="smile" border="0" />)  for a while, okay?<br /><br />And can anyone tell me about this - Abhishek pointed out that both the links to the feed in the sidebar (Atom and RSS) take you to the same place, ie, the Atom feed. If you hover over the link, you'll see atom.xml as the destination in the link to the RSS feed. But if you view the source, the same link says 'rss.xml'. What's on?
