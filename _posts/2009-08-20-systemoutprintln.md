So I'm taking these [Java][] classes.

They start at 1:30. The other students usually reach before me. They sit in silence, with the door closed and all the lights and ACs off. Everyone stares at the door till the teacher comes. The zips of my bag make very loud sounds as I open them. Our teacher looks at me and grins every time he uses the keyboard shortcut I pointed out to him. I make a feeble attempt at a chuckle.

Exaggeration *is* an infinite times worse than understatement.
