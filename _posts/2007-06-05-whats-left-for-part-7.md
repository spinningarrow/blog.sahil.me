When <span style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</span> was to be released, there were loads of such rumours about the last two books floating about. Let's see what's come true so far, and what's left to be known. [Stuff in <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">gray </span>is what's already come true, stuff in <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">blue </span>is what I'd like to know, and stuff in <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">red </span>is what I think is unlikely. Stuff in black: no comments :) ]

<ul style="line-height: 1.4em;">
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">We will learn a lot more about Voldemort in this book.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> will leave Privet Drive early again, for a "much pleasanter" reason than in book 5.</span> </li>
	<li>The opening chapter of book 6 was originally planned for the early parts of book 1; perhaps we get a more in-depth story of what happened the night <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span>'s parents died. </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Neither <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> nor Voldemort (including Tom Riddle) are the Half-Blood Prince.</li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Arthur Weasley will NOT be the new Minister of Magic.</li>
	<li>By the ends of books 6 and 7 "you'll have all the back story you'll need", says JK Rowling, and a prequel will not be necessary.</li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">There will be a new Minister of Magic, no more Mr. Cornelius Oswald Fudge.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">We will find out what happened to Hagrid's half brother Grawp. He will be a bit more controllable in book 6.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> The Dursleys are in the next book, but <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span>'s stay with them will be the shortest yet. In book 5 he stayed for 4 weeks, so we know his stay will be less than 4 weeks.</li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Cho Chang will not be a romantic interest of <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> in Book 6; however there will be a "<span style="font-style: italic;">little</span> romance" for <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> says JK.</li>
	<li>In books 6 and 7 we will find out exactly why JK killed off Sirius.</li>
	<li> <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> becomes even more powerful in book 6.<br /></li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> In books 6 and 7 we will find out why Dumbledore trusts Snape.</span> </li>
	<li>We will find out what happened to Wormtail aka Peter Pettigrew.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More about the animosity between Snape and Sirius will be revealed in the last 2 books.</span> </li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> JK has said that giving away the form of Snape's boggart and patronus says too much.</span> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">We'll definitely find out what Snape's worst fear is, and it'll be important.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Hermione and Draco will NOT end up together in book 6 or 7.</li>
	<li> We will find out what exactly Dudley saw when he looked at the dementors.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">The reason Voldemort and </span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> both didn't die when Voldemort tried to kill </span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">, will be revealed.</span> </li>
	<li> We will see more of Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, now that Lucius is busy. </li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">We'll learn more about </span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);" id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">'s scar in the last 2 books.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Moaning Myrtle will make an appearance again, as will Tonks.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> More about Voldemort's birth will be revealed, thus helping us understand why he is so evil.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> Muggles begin to notice "more and more odd" occurrences in book 6, says JK.</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">The wizarding world is really at war in the sixth book.</span> </li>
	<li> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> will tell his dearest friends about the prophecy after it sinks in to him.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">We will learn more about <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span>'s relatives, including his grandparents (though JK says they aren't really important to the story).</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">We will find out what happened to Sirius's motorbike.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Book 6 will be shorter than the 5th book (or at least JK's 99% sure, but will not swear on her children's lives)(it is, at any rate, more expensive).</li>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">There will be no "new" nationalities of children at Hogwarts. Hogwarts is a British school, and JK says that adding foreigners for the sake of it is not in her plans.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">During an interview, when JKR was asked in which Hogwarts room she'd like to be for 1 hour, she said it would be a room in which <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> has been before, but doesn't know its importance. Yet. (This could have happened in book 5, but we're unsure).</li>
	<li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">It's very important in the plot that <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> has his mother's eyes, and that her wand was very good for charms.</li>
	<li>During an interview for Kids BBC, Victor Greensteet (reporter) asked Rowling if <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> would have a dragon for a pet. This is what she replied: "You can't tame a dragon, no matter what Hagrid thinks. It's simply impossible. So no. He has more common sense. He MAY have a different pet in the future, but for now, I won't say anything else".<br /></li>
	<li> In the same interview for Kids BBC, the reporter asked J. K. if <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> had ever used the internet, and this is what she had to say: "No. They (the Dursleys) won't let him go near Dudley's computer, and Dudley is the only one who has a computer. They hit him if he gets too near to the keyboard. So the answer would be No. I use it a lot, but <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span> doesn't. <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Wizards don't really need to go on the web. They have an even better way to find out what's happening in the outside world, which I think is a lot more fun than the Internet, but I'm going to keep quiet on this one.</span>" </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">The choice between what's right and what's easy will be a pillar of the plot in <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span>'s last 2 years at Hogwarts.</li>
	<li> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);" id="st" name="st" class="st0">Harry</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">'s parents' profession will be a big part of the plot.</span> </li>
	<li style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Something HUGE will be revealed about Lily Potter.</li>
</ul>
