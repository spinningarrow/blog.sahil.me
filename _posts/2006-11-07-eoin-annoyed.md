Okay, so this isn't quite everything I wanted to say about Artemis Fowl: The
Lost Colony - in all probability, I still am going to say a lot more about it
sometime soon. I just guessed that not quite everyone I knew who likes the
series had read the latest book.<br />Well, anyway, I bought the hardcover
version of the book which, when I bought it, was the only one that existed
here. It looks really nice with its silver cover and red-lettering. The back
cover doesn't really tell you much - but what you <span style="font-style:
italic;">do</span> notice is that Eoin Colfer's finally realised that no one
who doesn't know him well can get his name right (and probably, many people who
do know him well can't get it either). So the book's cover mentions <span
style="font-style: italic;">twice</span> that 'Eoin' is pronounced as 'Owen'
with one of the mentions also carrying the comment 'Not as difficult as it
looks, is it?'

Anyway, today was another holiday - and tomorrow's going to be a holiday too.
That makes a total of four surprise holidays. It's getting a bit too much now,
especially with Exun and the German Exchange Assembly coming up.
