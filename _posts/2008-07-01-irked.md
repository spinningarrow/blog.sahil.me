1. I have exams - in approximately 14 hours. And I've realised that no matter how much time I get to prepare, I *always* end up studying till the last minute. Sheesh.

2. My internet has suddenly become *considerably* slower. I hope it doesn't have anything to do [with this][1]. And Firefox has been acting weirdly too. It won't let me open my [Google Reader][], won't let me watch [YouTube][] videos and it starts loading websites, then forgets all about it in the middle. It's probably 'cause of the baggage its been carrying from previous installations.

3. Some incredibly *stupid* birds have succeeded in building a nest on top of my AC. This would have been quite alright, since I don't mind birds as such, except that they make an insane amount of noise throughout the day (and night). And I'm *supposed* to be studying \*eyeroll\*.

4. I've realised that I can't listen to music during exams, for the simple reason that if I do, then whenever I'm studying, these songs start roaming around in my head. You try learning Chemistry equations with Metallica's *The Unforgiven* playing in the jukebox section of your brain :P.

5. It's irritating that I have to study a whole lot of stuff that I'll never need to know. They should have a system in which we're allowed to choose exactly the subjects we want and learn stuff that we'll actually need in our future careers, rather than messing around with a pile of tosh.

6. I hope Federer wins. It'll be incredibly irksome if he doesn't.

7. I [finally][2] managed to get a new string and a couple of picks for my guitar. It doesn't help that I'm not much closer to becoming good at it, though.

Oh, and watch the Federer Rolex ad - it's pretty cool:
