Okay, so that was one <span style="font-style: italic;">huge</span> hiatus.<br />So much has been happening, and I haven't written for <span style="font-style: italic;">so</span> long, I feel rather bad about it.<br /><br />We had EXUN 2006 and then DPSMUN (well, there was a difference of a whole month, but what can I say), both of which deserve their own posts, which I'll get around to doing sometime...<br /><br />And then, when I got into this mood of writing on my blog, I fell sick, which is becoming quite a feature of December, and - consequentially -  something I'm getting terrifically bugged about. I've just about recovered and I'm doubly put off about that.<br /><br />Plus, our pre-boards are coming and I'm sunk worse than a hundred-tonne lead sphere tied to another hundred-tonne lead sphere tossed from somewhere high up into the Pacific. So you can count me as triply put-off.<br /><br />By the way, I saw this message when I opened my Blogger Dashboard today, which means I'm allowed to switch to Blogger Beta (at last), and I'll be doing that soon, which also means this template will probably crash. You can expect it to have already happened, coz I'm gonna do it as soon as I press publish.

Oh and I found a nice tool that automatically updates your iTunes Library without needing to manually add songs to it. Happy Days!

The electricity's been going everyday for many everydays now. It's really very bugging, you know coz it always goes when I'm gonna do something important.<br /><br />Oh, and I'm switching anon commenting off, because of some dumb comments that keep cropping up in my inbox. I might even turn word verification on if this keeps up...<br /><br />Chalo then, I'm quitting now. By the way <abbr title="J K Rowling">JKR</abbr>'s decided on the title of the 7th book, it's - <span style="font-style: italic;">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</span> - sounds interesting, eh?
