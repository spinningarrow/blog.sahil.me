<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>The comments got turned off somehow. Don't ask me.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Another</span> really long, really abrupt pause (if I can use that here). The board exams came and went and in a few days, the results (yikes) will be coming out. Okay, so  just checked the CBSE Results site and <span style="font-style: italic;">class 12 results are out on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">25th</span></span>! So ours couldn't be more'n a couple of days away (relatively speaking, that is)!!!<br /><br />What else? Hmm, <span style="font-style: italic;">nm</span> as I would say if I were chatting right now. Which by the way, I'm not. I've somehow lost that oh-so-much interest that I used to have. That could, of course, be because I don't have <a href="http://adiumx.com/">Adium</a>.<br /><br />Oh btw, I <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> succeeded in relocating my blog (which you must've realised if you're here). Hope the new URL is easier to remember...<br />And, for those of you who were subscribing to my feed, it's (duh) changed. I'm also not using Blogger's feed thingy anymore. So the new URL is: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/sahil">http://feeds.feedburner.com/sahil</a>. Syndicate now!<br /><br />Anyway.<br />So, hmm, I can't remember what else I've been doing all this while, because it <span style="font-style: italic;">has</span> been sooo loong. I've realised that the only time I feel like writing a blog post, is when I'm <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> on the computer...<span style="font-style: italic;">weird</span>. Maybe I should get me a laptop.<br /><br />G2G.
