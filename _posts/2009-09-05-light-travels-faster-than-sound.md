I know that. In all probability, so do you. But *surely* that can't be the reason why I've started noticing this time lag between sight and sound while watching just about any video? First it was reserved to YouTube videos mostly, but now I notice it with TV shows too.

So is my brain unable to process two things simultaneously, or is it not just me? :P
