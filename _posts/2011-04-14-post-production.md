To cut a somewhat long story short, I acted in a proper play for the first time in my life, and was it fun or was it fun? Not only did the actual play go down pretty well (the audience definitely laughed at moments we never considered funny \[this, we decided, was a good thing\]) but the whole experience was also quite fantastic. Long daily rehearsals (especially in the last ten days leading to the play) where we'd randomly burst out laughing in the middle of a sombre scene (I wish we'd taken bloopers videos), ordering extra packets of chilli sauce from McDonald's so much so that the lady taking my order said she'd need to get it cleared by her manager, practicing voice warm-ups that would've made any eavesdropper suspect of a lack of mental faculties on the other side of the door, the crazy I-will-never-forget-it car ride with the cast, director and writer the night before the play which I'm sure puts a large number of roller-coasters to shame (don't worry Maggie, I enjoyed every minute of it, contrary to all the seemingly-terrified yells you might have heard from the back seat), being forced to get make-up put on my face (I swear the girls got a tonne of sadistic pleasure from putting heavy make-up on all the guys), the tired-but-happy journey back from Alliance Francaise at 2 a.m. after the play (by lorry, no less) – all I can say is, thank goodness I decided to turn up for auditions and decided to stick with it despite the time in the middle when I was feeling rather unenthusiastic about It All.

But now that the radiance of the hall production has been dulled by its culmination, I once again find myself taking a look at how gloriously devoid of work my life isn't. I really have to commend this semester for smoothly succeeding in putting [the previous one][1] well and truly to shame. This time around, I've barely been in touch with even my family and close friends, leave alone anyone else.

Take a look at all the work I had/have to complete this week:

1. Red Cross website - Monday
2. Red Cross Subcomm Appreciation Night video - Tuesday
3. CSC105 Lab 7 assignment - Thursday
4. CSC104 Lab 5 logbook - Thursday
5. Group Marketing Plan + Presentation - Friday
6. CSC110 Test B (final exam!) - Friday

Oh, and just in case you were wondering, the fact that none of those items have been struck through isn't because it slipped my mind.

And did I mention I have exams coming up in May? Four papers on three consecutive days – fantastic, don't you think?

**PS**: How in the world am I to fit all my stuff under a 20 kg luggage limit when I go back home for the summer?
