<blockquote>I can't believe the news today<br />I can't close my eyes<br />And make it go away<br />How long...How long must we sing this song?<br /><br />And it's true we are immune<br />When fact is fiction and TV reality<br />And today the millions cry<br />We eat and drink while tomorrow they die<br />- <span style="font-style: italic;">Sunday Bloody Sunday</span>, U2</blockquote>
<blockquote>More pain and misery in the history of mankind<br />Sometimes it seems more like<br />The blind leading the blind<br />It brings upon us more of famine, death and war<br />You know religion has a lot to answer for<br /><br />And all because of it youâ€™d think<br />That we would learn<br />But still the body count the city fires burn<br />Somewhere there's someone dying<br />In a foreign land<br />Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man<br />Tell me why, tell me why...<br />- <span style="font-style: italic;">For the Greater Good of God</span>, Iron Maiden<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote>Why can't we treat our fellow men<br />With more respect and a shake of their hands<br />But anger and loathing is rife<br />The death on all sides is<br />becoming a way of life<br /><br />But some are just not wanting peace<br />Their whole life is death and misery<br />The only thing that they know<br />Fight fire with fire life is cheap<br /><br />But if they do stop to think<br />That man is teetering right on the brink<br />But do you think that they care<br />They benefit from death and pain and despair<br />- <span style="font-style: italic;">The Legacy</span>, Iron Maiden<br /></blockquote>
<blockquote>The world is a dangerous place to live, not just because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.<br />- <span style="font-style:italic;">Albert Einstein</span></blockquote>
