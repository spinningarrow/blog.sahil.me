title: Writing anxiety
---

The longer I go without <del>writing</del> posting on my blog, the more
uncomfortable I begin to feel. Perhaps it's all the [idea debt][] in my head,
or it's something more. I don't know.

Interesting things happen, I make a mental note of writing about them, and then
I just watch them pass by. Then more interesting things happen based on those
that already happened, but I can't write about them I didn't write about the
ones that originally happened. You know what I mean?

I feel like I've written about this before. Or was it just another idea in my
head?
