> **Shifu**: Illusion?
>
> **Oogway**: Yes.
> Look at this tree, Shifu: I cannot make it blossom when it suits me nor make it bear fruit before its time.
>
> **Shifu**: But there are things we *can* control: I can control when the fruit will fall, I can control where to plant the seed: that is no illusion, Master!
>
> **Oogway**: Ah, yes. But no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.
