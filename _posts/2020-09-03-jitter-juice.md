It was not too long ago that I had pretty much never tasted coffee, especially
not in its black variety. I remember sipping a suspicious mouthful and nearly
gagging: _ugh, it’s so bitter! How can you like it?_ ("Pair it with
cheesecake!" was the reply, which I grudgingly acknowledged to be a rather good
idea).

That changed one fateful morning when someone -- on noticing my yawn during a
meeting -- kindly remarked that perhaps I was in need of a cup of coffee. I
suspiciously decided to give the suggestion a shot. Its effect was revelatory:
I feel like I haven’t yawned since.

Thus began my voyage of coffee consumption. I decided that I would learn to not
discern (ever since I [bought nicer headphones][] I've been [trapped][] [in][]
[a][] world of audiophilia -- _it won't happen again!_ I told myself). I drank
all kinds of coffee -- from the machine at work, instant powder, from Starbucks
(in a cup with my name misspelt, of course!), sometimes even drinks that were
more sugar than coffee. I tried Singapore's local favourites
[Kopi-O][kopi-guide] and its brethren, although those didn't really stick.

Then I moved to Hamburg, Europe’s number one destination for coffee shipments
from all over the world. Despite the city’s obvious love for coffee, evidenced
by [entire warehouses][] devoted to it and the [many][hermetic]
[many][surf-shop] [wonderful][tornqvist] [cafes][public-coffee], I remained
steadfast in maintaining my lack of coffee-consciousness.

But then the largest ever work from home experiment happened and suddenly my
daily drowsiness-defusing dose disappeared. Sleep proved elusive but
work did not -- it was time for a Home Coffee Plan.

I weighed my options: there was the tried, tested, and tasteless instant coffee
powder, the filter coffee machine that came and went with my previous
apartment, the venerable French Press, the convenient but ecologically-hostile
Nespresso machine, the moka pot…

Then I remembered a conversation with a colleague from years ago when I had
just started at ThoughtWorks -- there was a product he’d mentioned whose name
had stuck in my head. That sounded like exactly what I needed! So after a few
clicks and a couple of days, yours truly became the happy owner of a beautiful
little [AeroPress][]:

Nearly a hundred cups later I can say I’m very pleased with it, for many
reasons:

1. It’s easy to use: throw in coffee, add water, and press. From beginning to
   end it takes about 5-7 minutes to brew a tasty cup.

2. The build is sturdy and light -- it feels like it will last forever. Since
   it’s completely manually operated, there are no fragile tiny pieces and the
   only “moving part” is the plunger that is moved manually.

3. Easy to clean: run it under the tap and you're done.

4. Cheap! At under 30 bucks I should be able to replace it quite easily if
   something were to happen to it

5. Well known: there are tons of videos on YouTube about it, even a [Reddit
   community][r-aeropress]!

Things are different now since the arrival of the AeroPress. I spend more time
thinking about coffee. My YouTube home page is filled with [videos][] of a guy
with great hair and a calming voice who uses words like “body” and “blend”. I
had a lengthy conversation with a barista in which I tried to explain my
brewing style so that she could grind the beans to the right size. I researched
home coffee grinders and nearly threw away my laptop in horror (_two hundred
and forty euros just so I can grind by hand?!_).

It seems I've come a long way from the days when I wrinkled my nose at this
suspicions dark liquid. What will tomorrow bring? Not coffee withdrawal, I
hope!
