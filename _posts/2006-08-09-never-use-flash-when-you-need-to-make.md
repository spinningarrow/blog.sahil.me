Argh!

Things have really reached an all-time low. Apart from being busy, I'm also getting really bored now. Reduced to make you read such a boring post, without any proper title as this one. You know, when I started this blog, it was basically because I had so many nice ideas about what to post about. Of course, once I <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> make it, all the ideas simply went on a long holiday.<br /><br />I don't seem to be getting much time to sit down and write posts either, when it comes to that. Basically, I'm doing this right now coz today was a holiday. My sister(s) came and tied <span style="font-style: italic;">rakhis</span> following which they inisisted on ballooning my mouth with <span style="font-style: italic;">rasgullas</span>.

I also (finally) installed .NET 2.0, due to which I was able to use TuneSleeve,
which I must say, works really well, and is really useful.

The other day I went to Montfort for a competition. It was pretty normal
(compared to BVN at any rate). The gaming finals were quite enjoyable. They
had this XBOX on which the 2 finalists had to play Pro Evolution Soccer, and
man, what graphics!  It was almost as good as watching real people play, albeit
in real life, you'd never get AC Milan playing against Argentina. Meanwhile,
(while we were watching that is) they gave us these manila folders, containing
the participation certificates (though we didn't open the folders). After that
we had the prize distribution. After we all got our prizes (our school came
first overall by the way), we went back to our seats and opened the folders
containing the participation certificates, only to find that the certificates
for the individual prizes were also in there! I mean, we could have easily seen
that we'd come first in web-d and quizzing if we'd just opened that.

Ah well.
