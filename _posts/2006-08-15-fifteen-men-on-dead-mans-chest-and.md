<span style="font-size:78%;">This is the second time I'm typing this whole thing out. Really, it's too much. The electricity has gone for over 3 hours today. It goes each and every time when I have time to do something on the computer. And of course, the UPS can only show it's total lack of being </span><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:78%;" >un</span><span style="font-size:78%;">interrupted...</span>

Well, okay, if you want to be really technical about it, not quite fifteen men and not quite just a single bottle of rum.<br /><br />So, finally, after long waiting, I saw the movie. And, to my surprise, I <span style="font-style: italic;">didn't</span> get blown up, what with all the terrorists being around and all. <span style="font-style: italic;">And</span> we were sitting in  the very second row from the front - not very nice. I had thought that since the movie's been here for like a month, everyone should have seen it by now - obviously not.<br /><br />Anyway, so, on the whole, the movie was, I suppose, quite good. The acting, as always, (especially Johnny Depp's) was superb. And, of course, the wisecracks were there, though I don't think they were quite as many as in the first movie.<br /><br />Besides that, the story was OK - it seemed to be, at some points of time, a mixture of a load of other stories like <span style="font-style: italic;">Treasure Island</span> and all. And the creatures in Davy Jones' army were a tad more grotesque than need be - actually they were quite repulsive and sick-looking. Oh, and, those who didn't like the dirty teeth in the first movie get a load more sets of dirty teeth to not like. And you're better off not thinking much about the euphemisms in the tribal island part.<br /><br />All in all, not a movie you'd watch while eating your dinner, for more reasons than one. But it was OK, except it ended on a rather abrupt note, and the ending was entirely spoilt by a) Sushant Tandon and b) a newspaper article which mentioned that Geoffrey Rush was part of the cast...whoops! (shouldn't I have mentioned "spoiler warning"?).
