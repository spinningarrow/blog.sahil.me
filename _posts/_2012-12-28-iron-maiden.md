title: “I felt I was in a trance, and my spirit was lifted from me”

Flashes from Singapore Indoor Stadium on 15 February 2011:

*“<abbr class="acronym">SISTIC</abbr> sucks, <abbr class="acronym">SISTIC</abbr> sucks!”*

Everyone took up the chant as we waited outside the stadium in the pouring rain, courtesy the frightful crowd management.

*"The bugle sounds as the charge begins!"*

Peeking over people's shoulders at shouts of "there's Bruce Dickinson!" as we stood outside the doors. Nearly dashing through the security check out of sheer excitement. Running full tilt across the dark stadium to get as close to the stage.

*"Olé, olé olé olé, Maiden, Maiden!"*

Being squeezed, pushed from all sides. Nearly turning to pulp pretty much all the time.  Raising our hands. Cheering. Breathing in the excitement. We still managed to sing for Maiden to take the stage.
Inching forwards ever so slowly during the opening act to reach the second row from the stage, just in time for Satellite 15's backdrop of twinkling stars.

*"And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them!"*

Chanting – no, *yelling* – the lyrics to <cite>The Trooper</cite> and <cite>2 Minutes to Midnight</cite>. Jumping to the melodic mastery that is <cite>Dance of Death</cite>. Headbanging to <cite>The Evil That Men Do</cite>. Singing, several thousand strong, the introductory verse of <cite>Fear of the Dark</cite>. Watching, spellbound, as <cite>When the Wild Wind Blows</cite> and <cite>Hallowed Be Thy Name</cite> came to life.

*"Could I believe, that what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?"*<br>

Signalling the security guards in front for a paper cup of water. Watching as random members of the crowd were lifted across to the guards who carried them away because they had fainted. Getting buffeted by the frenzied crowd.
Bruce, jumping up and throwing off his cap, the stage sprayed with the sweat of two hours of musical magnificence.

Walking out, dazed, at the end of the concert and collapsing on the pavement.

*The dream is true, the dream is true.*

**PS**: Some people were actually *sitting* in the stands.

**PPS**: As I was packing up my room in NTU the other day, I found these in one of my notebooks:
