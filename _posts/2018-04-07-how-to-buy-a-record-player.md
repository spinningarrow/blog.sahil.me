1. Fall in love with your grandfather's customised record player and wonderful
   speakers when you listen to his records as a young kid.

2. Accidentally walk into The Adelphi in your first few weeks in Singapore
   and ogle at all the fancy audio equipment. More than half the shops there
   look like living rooms -- replete with comfy sofas to sit back in and enjoy
   the music. One of them even has guitars hanging on the walls!

3. Do a bit of research into the cost of said audio equipment. Step back from
   your computer screen in horror for the next lifetime or so.

4. Don't let that stop you from looking at all record players making
   appearances all over Singapore -- even [Robinson's][] has them!

5. Make the final payment of your student loan just before Christmas.

6. ’Tis the season to be jolly! Maybe I should celebrate by gifting myself
   something. How about a ... record player?!

7. Look at reviews, visit some record stores, and talk to old uncles in the
   basement of The Adelphi. Look at more reviews while visiting stores. Compare
   prices on Amazon and be surprised. Visit more stores and keep teetering on
   making a decision because no one else you know can provide advice on this
   esoteric hobby.

8. Finally buy [a beautiful one][rega-planar-1] and bring it home.

9. Don’t forget to buy some records too! It’s okay if the record store guy
   convinces you to buy an album that you’d never normally listen to because
   "it sounds so good!"

10. Agonise over the poor wiring in your house causing your new equipment to
	sound noisy.

11. Try many different ways of debugging and fixing it.

12. Give up and make peace with it.

13. [Buy some more records][my-discogs]. Admire the beautiful artwork. Play
	them. That’s what it’s all about anyway!

14. Sit back. Close your eyes.

15. Listen. _Listen!_

It's worth mentioning that steps 8, 13, and 15 are really the most crucial
ones. In fact I could go so far as to say that all the other steps can be
safely ignored. Most importantly, enjoy the music!
