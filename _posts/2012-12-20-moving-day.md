<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I've been saying this <a href="http://sahilb.blogspot.in/2012/08/on-my-mind.html">for</a> <a href="http://sahilb.blogspot.in/2010/03/moving-to-antarctica-sounds-like.html">terribly</a> <a href="http://sahilb.blogspot.in/2012/06/hang-on-dont-i-have-psp.html">long</a>, so without further ado, I'd like to announce that I have succeeded in moving this blog to a new home! *cue drumroll* The new address is:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.sahil.me/"><span style="font-size: 2em;">blog.sahil.me</span></a></div><br />For the feed junkies, you don't need to update the URL (thanks to FeedBurner) but it probably wouldn't hurt to check that it's all working (I fear you might see old posts reappearing as unread posts, my apologies for that). For the others, update your bookmarks!<br /><br /><b>PS</b>: The new home is still a little rough around the edges, give it some time. Though if anything looks too strange, let me know.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE</b>: I've imported all posts from 2008 and later to the new blog. For posts from 2007 and 2006, please see the archives.</div>
