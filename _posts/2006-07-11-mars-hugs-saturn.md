Me, I don't believe in astrology, no sir. Probably for the main reason that astrologers are hardly ever right, like in this example: An astrologer said that Brazil was going to win the World Cup, and, of course, when Brazil went for a six, he must've felt really <span style="font-style: italic;">stupid</span>. So here's the pithy way in which he tries to defend himself, "Well, you know, my prediction that Brazil would win the Cup was made just for fun, it wasn't based on any theory as such." Really!<br />So, well, going by all this, you can't really blame me when - weeks ago - Mars came close to Saturn for the first time in ever so many years, and astrologers said that the World Cup would have an unlikely winner. Slowly, of course, this began to come true as Brazil lost. But, even then, I couldn't have imagined that <span style="font-style: italic;">Italy</span> would take away the cup. Sad...even till the final, I was rooting for France.<br />Then of course, Zizou <span style="font-style: italic;">had</span> to go and start headbutting people. I mean, he really shouldn't have lost control like that - if he'd been there, France <span style="font-style: italic;">might just</span> have won the Cup (though there's no saying about that - Buffon's a good goal keeper). Still, Zidane did at least win the Golden Ball.

Whew! The 6-0 match was really...<span style="font-style: italic;">cool</span>. Nadal was literally <span style="font-style: italic;">trembling</span> like hell. But Federer did, eventually beat Nadal even though it was only the second time out of eight. But this Nadal, he's a big liar, don't you know? He said that there was no way he was going to do well in the Wimbledon, he just hoped to improve himself on grass - and there he went soaring on to the final and even managed to take a set off Federer! Don't get me wrong - Nadal <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> one of my favourites, but only when he isn't playing Federer.
