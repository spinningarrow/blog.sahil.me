I recently discovered Johnny Flynn's music and I've been listening to it on
regular repeat ever since. His songs have a folksy/indie vibe with a vocal
melody that I always fail to predict (although that may well be down to my lack
of a musical ear!). The lyrics are often surprisingly poetic with lots of
imagery -- for instance, here's the first verse of _Hard Road_:

> The sea came in and washed me out  
> The way was carved in ice  
> The tokens of a buried past  
> The shavings of a heavy life  
> The wind blows each and every way  
> It's not for me, my heart, to steer  
> I cast up what I have each day  
> The river flows the whole long year

Someone commented on one of his YouTube videos that they always come back to
his music in the autumn, which I've found is also quite fitting for
Hamburg's soggy winters. Another favourite of mine is _Wandering Aengus_,
purportedly about getting in touch with nature (a theme that I can always get
behind!):

> Walking in my mourning in the morning  
> Let me tell you of the ashes of the great  
> Sun is ris'n for dawning, let the dawn in  
> Let me lift my heart and free my song from pain

I'm the kind of person that watches very few TV shows, but when I find one I
like, I re-watch the heck out of it. One such has been _Lovesick_ on Netflix. I
love the characters and their acting, and the premise is ridiculous when you
think about it, but makes for good comic relief. The timeline alternates
between present day and flashbacks and manages to include some meaningful
insights into the characters. Johnny Flynn plays the lead role -- that's
actually how I found out about his music (thanks, YouTube algorithm! It almost
makes up for the aggravating increase in ads in all the videos nowadays!)

Spotify recently reminded everyone of the impending end of the year with their
"2020 Wrapped" showcase. Mine told me that I listened to 381 genres this year
(I didn't know there were so many!) and also that my top podcasts are all in
German (which is curious, because not only do I only rarely listen to podcasts,
but I also never listen to any on Spotify!). They do seem to have gotten my top
artists down correctly, though I was probably expecting either Tool, Animals as
Leaders, or Plini to be in there as well:

I'm also [back on Last.fm][last-fm] now (does anyone remember it?!). It
integrates a lot better with Spotify now, which comes in quite handy since
Spotify makes it really hard to find one's listening history.

Time to listen to more music! ðŸŽ¶
