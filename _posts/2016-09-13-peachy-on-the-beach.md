Batam was *supposed* to be Cambodia. Or Laos. Or even Vietnam. But if you plan
to travel during a public holiday in Singapore, you can't leave such decisions
to the last minute – or even a month before the last minute. So Batam it was.

We stayed at KTM Resort which is a five-minute drive from the Sekupang ferry
terminal. The staff were nice, the room cozy, and the hot water in the shower
woefully limited. The food at the hotel's restaurant was quite decent albeit
starvation-inducingly slow to appear. There  was also a bar that's open in the
evenings and plays good music (I heard what is purportedly the new Coldplay; it
seems like they make club music now), from where you can order food and eat by
the poolside despite a sign that clearly prohibits the consumption of food and
drinks by the pool.

The first afternoon found us signing up for massages, which turned out to be
pleasant enough that we booked them again the second morning. It was quite
peaceful – lying in a cottage listening to the waves gently crash along the
walls, an Indonesian lady deftly cracking my toe joints while simultaneously
failing to avoid coughing on me. So it goes.

Being by the sea and all, the resort had a bunch of not-cheap water sporting
activities. Since we had nothing to do on the second day, we quickly signed up
for all the ones that didn't depend on one's swimming skills (which I still
lack). First up was something called "hammerhead" – a round floating bed-like
device roped to a motorboat. You (and friends) grab on to a couple of handholds
and hang on for dear life while the boatman tries his level best to throw you
into the ocean. Thumbs up, would recommend it be tried at least once.

Next we tried paddling. This was pretty fun, and quite an exercise in balancing
on a board floating on its merry way in the sea. You are given a piece of
glorified wood to provide an illusion of control over the board's destiny but
worry not, for it will do as it pleases including crashing into the wooden
beams on which your resort's restaurant stands. Also quite fun.

The last activity was easily the best though – jet skiing! Unsurprisingly it is
not as easy as it looks since the sea attempts to unseat you with every wave,
but it's oh so fun! Going really fast with the wind whistling in your ears and
the water spraying in your face and being launched into mid-air whenever
there's a medium-sized wave – I have to say it's quite exciting.

And that's about it for yet another long weekend gone by!
