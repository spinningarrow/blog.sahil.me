Okay, first of all, here's wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas.

<img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5501/1040/400/208465/seasonoflight_xthumb.jpg" alt="" border="0" />

Now, second of all, there is really nothing to be really merry about, as far as I can see.

1. We didn't celebrate. Not that I really celebrate, but not even a simple Christmas tree or anything this time.
2. I haven't celebrated for the past 2 years.
3. Our pre-boards are starting soon. Too soon.
4. Blogger is out of beta (That's the good bit). It refuses to let me switch (that's the bad bit).

Anyway...

PS. I love Firefox's SpellCheck feature
