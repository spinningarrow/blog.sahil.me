Okay, first of all, here's wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5501/1040/1600/564934/seasonoflight_xthumb.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5501/1040/400/208465/seasonoflight_xthumb.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Now, second of all, there is really nothing to be really merry about, as far as<br />I can see.<br />1. We didn't celebrate. Not that I really celebrate, but not even a simple Christmas tree or anything this time.<br />2. I haven't celebrated for the past 2 years.<br />3. Our pre-boards are starting soon. Too soon.<br />4. Blogger is out of beta (That's the good bit). It refuses to let me switch (that's the bad bit)<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />PS. I love Firefox's SpellCheck feature
