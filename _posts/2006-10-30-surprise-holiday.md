I really like surprise holidays. Simply because you get to know just a few
hours before that "school's gonna be closed tomorrow". And especially in this
case, the school actually sent us <span
style="font-style:italic;">e-mails</span> to inform us about the holiday.
Sweet!

So, it's a holiday today basically because of some trader's <span
style="font-style:italic;">bandh</span> due to which there are going to be
agitations/protests (in other words, the usual) and our school's worried that
we might be caught in the fray. One of the few times the school's actually
worried about our safety. The nice bit is that since it's a 72 hour thing, even
tomorrow <span style="font-style:italic;">might</span> just be a holiday. But I
mustn't get my hopes up.

Blogger's really been acting up the past few days - I had quite a bit of
trouble republishing my blog. Also the comment counters on most blogs weren't
updating themselves...sigh. You can read about the publishing prob <a
