It's been really long since I've known this - just never got around to posting about it (especially since it wasn't exactly <span style="font-style: italic;">good</span> news from my point of view). Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, for those of you didn't know, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eddie is coming to India!</span><br /><br />It was just recently that I was wondering - without much hope - how cool it would be if Iron Maiden came to India (without much hope because when you live here, you don't dream that such things could actually <span style="font-style: italic;">happen</span>). And then, when I came to know that they were coming, I got all excited, but then I saw this:

See what I mean? First of all, for some unbelievably stupid reason they're playing in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangalore</span> of all places, and secondly it's smack-in-the-middle of our boards! Really sad ... because it's gonna be great - they're air-freighting <span style="font-style: italic;">20 tonnes</span> of equipment for the concert, including a whole <span style="font-style: italic;">stage</span> (thus turning hopeless dreams into reality <span style="font-weight: bold;">:)</span> ).<br /><br />They <a href="http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=8&p2_articleid=444">recently played in Dubai</a> - the highlight of which was that they brought a whole freakin' <span style="font-style: italic;">tank</span> to the concert!

Anyway, I hope it comes on TV at least ...
