I know, another rather long hiatus, partly due to my Mumbai trip, and partly for no reason at all ;) . Another post describing my (very) (un)memorable trip is due, but here's what just happened:<br /><br />Most techies would have heard of the site <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a>. I began reading it some time back (it's quite useful; you don't really need to be a techy to read it - and it's also one of my favourite sites as of now). Anyway, so they recently announced this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/shortcut-screencast-contest/screencast-your-favorite-shortcut-for-a-signed-copy-of-lifehacker-272859.php">Shortcut screencast contest</a> where you send a screencast of a quick way you know of doing something on your computer, and if they like it, you get a prize (they had ten prizes to give away).<br /><br />So I sent my entry a few days back - I thought it was quite good, but I didn't have that much hope since it was my first ever screencast and it didn't come out too well. Plus, the same day as I submitted my entry, someone else won. But - you know where this is going - I WON!!<br /><br />Here's the screencast I sent:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center"><embed style="width: 400px; height: 326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=5480342814427438103&amp;hl=en-CA" flashvars=""></embed></div><br /><br />Or you can check out the Lifehacker page <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/shortcut-screencast-contest/create-custom-windows-keyword-launchers-275073.php">here</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, I was left a bit confused when they didn't ask me my address (how the hell would they send me the book?). So I wrote to them and got an answer in 20 minutes flat (talk about speed). I sent my address, and now I hope I get the book soon. Really soon.
