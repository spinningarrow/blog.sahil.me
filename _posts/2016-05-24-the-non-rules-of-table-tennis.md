title: The non-rules of table tennis
category: sports

One thing I miss about working at Autodesk (yeah, that happened) is playing
table tennis regularly. I used to play a fair bit when I was in school but
almost entirely stopped during the four years of university. I've been trying
to join some table tennis meetups recently ([Meetup][] is awesome in that
regard), but it has been pretty sporadic so far.

When I started playing again, I was a little surprised to learn that the rules
had changed somewhat. After a bit of research spurred on by an office
tournament that I took part in, I realised that all of the "rules" below
were made up! Here's the list (the explanations are thanks to some Googling and
the [official ITTF handbook][]):

1. Deciding who will serve by playing a rally

	This one felt wrong even when we were doing it all those years ago.
	Basically, deciding which player will serve is done by a toss (or something
	similar). Choosing by playing a single point doesn't really make much
	sense, especially when you think about all the *other* silly rules tacked
	on top of it, e.g. you can't smash in this 'deciding' rally.

2. Allowing re-serves up to a maximum of three times

	If the ball touches the net when serving, the player serves again. Turns
	out there's no limit to the number of times this can consecutively occur. I
	suppose the limit of three came from lawn tennis or something.

3. Losing the point by banging the racket on the table

	Sometimes when returning an especially short low ball, the racket can
	accidentally end up hitting the table. This is perfectly fine, unless it
	causes the table to move in which case it is perfectly not-fine.

4. Losing a point by accidentally hitting the ball with your hand instead of
   the racket

	This I suppose is only partly true – it's fine insofar as the part that
	touches the ball is below the wrist.

5. Catching the ball after tossing it when serving

	I've seen variations on this one – some folks consider it a 'let' if the
	server's racket moved but didn't hit the ball, others allow the server to
	catch the ball after tossing it up as long as they didn't move their
	racket. Both are illegal serves.

6. Returning a shot that goes out/volleying

	As long as it happens outside the playing surface (i.e. the table), this is
	okay.

Interestingly, these so-called rules  weren't local to just my group of friends
in school – coworkers I recently played with followed some of them too. I even
found folks from some other countries following them, which makes me wonder if
perhaps they _used_ to be rules but no longer are.
