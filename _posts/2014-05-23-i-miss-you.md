Ten days isn't a terribly long time, but this feels like an eternity. You see, I'm not used to being away from you. Other than that period not too long ago, we've seen each other nearly every day since we first met!

That seems to have been ages ago, doesn't it? Was it [love at first sight][love]? Is there even such a thing? I can't say. You certainly caught my eye, that I do remember clearly. As I got to know you better, I knew this could be the start of something both beautiful and exigent. I pondered a lot – would my inexperience be a hindrance? Was I biting off more than I could chew? Time — did I have enough of it? What if I doesn't work out? Ah, but what if it does?

Sometimes I still don't know what I'm doing. Play it by the ear, they say. Well I might be a little tone deaf, despite Benjamin Zander's claims to the contrary.

Sometimes I just want to hold you, to slowly caress you, to listen quietly as I ask you to sing.

Oh well. I don't know what this will lead to. What I do know is that there are just a few more days before I see you again, my beloved guitar!
