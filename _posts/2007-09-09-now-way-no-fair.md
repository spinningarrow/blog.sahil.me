<a href="http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=8&p2_articleid=664">Iron Maiden's coming to India AGAIN!</a> And they're coming in February (or March) AGAIN!<br />Why the hell can't they come when we <span style="font-style: italic;">don't</span> have exams?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ironmaiden.com/images/homepage/hompage.jpg" /><br /></div><br />The concert is titled "Somewhere Back In Time" because it's a visit to the past. They'll be playing songs from the pre-90s (upto Seventh Son of a Seventh Son), which is basically when most of the golden songs were made.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ironmaiden.com/images/news/lineup.jpg" /></div>
