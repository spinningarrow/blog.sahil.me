title: To the most missed
---

It was about two years ago that we first met.

*

This was something that I didn't know a whole lot about - what if I made the wrong choice?

I took some time to think. By some counts, *too* much time.

There's always a bit of risk - but if you never try, then you never will know.

Norway was difficult - the longest time I've been away. Sure, there have been other times when one of us wasn't there, but it was never this bad. I missed you almost everyday. And though I met many others, none of them was quite the same as you.

And I'm sorry for those two times - you know the ones I'm talking about. It was never intentional, and though I didn't show it, I was every bit as hurt as you.
