title: To the one I miss the most
---

We met more than two years.

I was hesitant at first - this was something that required an investment, a commitment - not something to be taken lightly and then forgotten.

It's funny but when we first met, I had a feeling. I didn't say anything then because, well I guess I first wanted to keep my options open, you know? And this was something I really didn't know a lot about - what if I made the wrong choice? So I turned my back and let it lie.
