title: Why I bought a Mac
---

* personal preference
* design
* hardware
* battery life
* OS X

But let's see... it's not a very easy question to answer because at least for me, the initial decision to buy one was partly just because of personal preference. But let me try to come up with some stuff. Regarding the price, which is the main thing people keep harping on about - yes, you do pay a premium and you could get a computer with the same specs for much lesser. But specs aren't everything. A lot of my friends here have all kinds of Windows laptops, and I'm still to find one which is built as well as (or even close to as well as) a mac. Aside from the fact that it looks very good and very sleek and all that (and though other manufacturers have tried to copy the design, especially the Macbook Air's design, I think if you see the two side by side you can easily see all the ways in which the copies fall short). Also, the trackpad on a macbook is honestly the best trackpad I've used; this is the only laptop on which I can actually survive for a long time without needing a mouse (I can even Photoshop and play games like Quake to a certain extent with the trackpad, which is something I wouldn't even think of doing on other laptops).

The screen is another thing I really like which I haven't been able to find on other cheaper laptops. It's really sharp and the colours are pretty good and things just look *so* much nicer. And if you think about it, the keyboard/trackpad and the screen are things that you interact with the most when you're using a laptop and Apple does a lot to make things really good on that front. Also, there are all these little details like when you change the brightness on the screen (or the keyboard backlights) on other laptops I've seen it literally looks as if with every increasing step, more lights are being switched on. On the mac though, even that sort of transition is smooth. And it adjusts the brightness depending on ambient light which is pretty nice too. The keyboard also has this thing where they make it difficult to accidentally press caps lock while typing (if you just touch tap it, it doesn't work; you have to deliberately press it to activate it).

So the hardware and all the little details that come with are things that I actually think are worth paying that extra for. They're things that make me want to keep using my laptop just because it's such a nice experience - I rarely feel frustrated when I'm using it (which at least with me happens a lot with other laptops).

Also, the battery life. This thing can last a whole day of college without needing to be recharged - and this is not like with the brightness turned down to minimum and wifi off - it's while using it normally (though yes, if you stream a lot of videos and whatnot, the battery life goes down). But I hear the newer macbooks have even better battery life.

On the software side, I really like OS X. You could say it's a personal preference but I honestly think it's just a little bit nicer than Windows. For an everyday user, things are often simpler (want to uninstall an app? just open the Applications folder and delete it - no Add/Remove Programs stuff!). The webcam, mic things just work; there are rarely any core hardware issues because Apple makes their hardware so the OS always knows what it's got and how to optimize things and just make everything smooth. So far, I've never seen a 'blue screen' (this does exist in OS X; it's called a kernel panic but it's not actually blue :P). Also, this probably won't apply to you but I find OS X much easier and nicer for programming (because it's based on Unix; Linux is just as good for programming if not better but what I don't like about Linux is that it just doesn't look as polished).

I think those are the main reasons. It just depends on what you care about; many of my friends are more than happy with their Windows/Linux laptops and that's fine. I just don't think I could go back to one after using a mac.

On the flipside, everything isn't always rosy. Strange things sometimes do happen, OS X is capable of doing weird things (recently when I was upgrading it, it told me that I had '-6 minutes remaining' for the install :P). I also had some problems with my battery and had to get it replaced but that was a little bit my fault. Oh and Microsoft Office for the mac is slower than it is on Windows which is pretty annoying but nowadays I find myself using it lesser and lesser. iTunes is much faster than on Windows though (obviously).

Basically, it's a good machine. I don't know of anyone who got a mac and regretted it. When I came to NTU, I'd already decided I wanted one (though if I'm not wrong, they're cheaper here than in India so) and when it's time to buy a new laptop, I'm pretty sure I'd get another mac.
