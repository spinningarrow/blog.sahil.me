title: Two Years Later - Hallo, Deutschland!
category: germany
---

Moin from the rainy city of Hamburg, Germany's bastion of the north where I have now been for more than _two_ years! (two years?! When did that even happen?)

Despite the duration of my current residence, I never really got around to blogging much about it (I never really got around to blogging much at all, but that is a lament for another day). So without any further ado, here's a post about some of the little oddities that I came across after moving here:

* Square pillows: on the bed of my first (temporary) accommodation, I found a pair of rather large, misshapen pillows that were decidedly square. I initially putting this down to one of those hotel oddities, and only later realised that this was not only the norm, but people actually seem to like them! The standard size is 80x80 square -- I once made the mistake of buying a non-misshapen one from IKEA and it took up over half my bed. There actually are smaller ones, but these are a mystifyingly narrow version -- 40x80 so half the height of the square ones, which essentially makes them too small. And the sad part is that if you do even manage to procure a regular sized pillow, good luck finding a pillow case that fits!

* Home addresses: every country does this differently. In Germany, the postcode comes _before_ the city name and most addresses do not contain an apartment number. This is because the names of all the inhabitants of an apartment building are listed outside the building, a visitor need only ring the bell corresponding to the name in order to be buzzed in (which leads to a fun walk up the stairs peering at every door if the person forgets to tell you which floor they live on). The whole system strikes me as rather curious, because in many other aspects German society champions privacy (it's one of the most oft-cited reasons for people preserving cash instead of the much more convenient cards, and also why it's the only country in the EU to have terrible Google street view)

* Carbonated water: it's everywhere. Woe betide you if you order water and forget to specify that you prefer still water. Not only will you imagine yourself being judged, but you'll also have to drink something that is as unlike water as it possibly could be. In the supermarket, bottled water usually comes in three varieties: still, carbonated, and even more carbonated. Most water dispensing machines have carbonated as the largest, easiest to press button, which of course yours truly fell victim to in his first days here. It is not altogether very surprising to eventually learn that the stuff was actually invented here.

* Prost! Or German for "cheers" (side note: it's kinda sad that Hindi does not have its own version of "cheers" -- whenever a bunch of people from different countries gather for drinks, everyone talks about how they say "cheers" in their language and when it's my turn I have to sheepishly explain that the only one I know from India is the regular run-of-the-mill "cheers"). This is something you say when everyone gets their drinks but here's the twist -- it is common to clink glasses/bottles _individually_ with every person present, which is quite a feat. Another rule is to look the other person in their eyes while doing so -- forgetting to do this comes with the curse of seven years of bad sex, which is quite a disproportionate retaliation if you think about it.

* Greetings are different in different regions of Germany. In Hamburg and the North, "moin" is the way to go, or "moin moin" if you want to self-identify yourself as not being from the region. The linguist in me absolutely loves these regional variations, although apparently not enough to remember any of the other ones.
